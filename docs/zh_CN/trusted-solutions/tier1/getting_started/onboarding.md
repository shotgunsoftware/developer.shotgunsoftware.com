# Onboarding Process

Leveraging the isolation features requires adopters to become AWS users. In order to ensure that this joint venture between Autodesk, AWS, and our clients is as streamlined as possible, we decided to work closely with AWS to define a cooperative onboarding process that would meet client expectations for a premium offering.

Autodesk and Amazon will provide dedicated resources during the onboarding process to help you on this journey.

To start the on-boarding process for any of the Isolation features, please open a [{% include product %} Support ticket](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/contact-support), before proceeding with [your setup](../setup/setup.md)

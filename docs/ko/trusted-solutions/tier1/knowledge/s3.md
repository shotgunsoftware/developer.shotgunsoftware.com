# S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object storage service offered by AWS. It can be thought of as a highly durable storage space in the cloud. {% include product %} uses S3 to store uploaded media and files.

In order to use {% include product %} isolation features, you will bring your own S3 bucket and configure {% include product %} to use it for storage. Please refer to our [S3 Bucket Setup article](../setup/s3_bucket.md) for details on how to do this.

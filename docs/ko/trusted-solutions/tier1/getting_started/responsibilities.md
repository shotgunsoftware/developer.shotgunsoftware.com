# Client Responsibilities

Below, we have outlined setup responsibilities between Autodesk and You. 

## Isolation Setup

You are entirely responsible for the validity, security, and execution of the Isolation setup in Your AWS Account. Autodesk should not, under any circumstances, be granted access to Your AWS environment.
 
Autodesk is available during the process for assistance, but the configuration of Isolation features in Your AWS Account is to be executed by You on Your own.

Isolation feature set activation requires the {% include product %} Support team's intervention. Activation delays are to be expected and will depend on demand. You understand that an estimated period of 2-8 weeks is usually required to complete the setup necessary to implement the isolation feature set. The setup time is highly dependent on your cooperation, so please plan to dedicate resources for the setup before beginning the onboarding process.

Autodesk does not guarantee any timeline for setup completion.

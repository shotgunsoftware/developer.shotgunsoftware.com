# Private Link

[AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) is an AWS service that connects different AWS VPCs without going through the public internet. 

In conjunction with [AWS Direct Connect](./direct_connect.md), PrivateLink helps create a dedicated connection between your studio and Shotgun's infrastructure.

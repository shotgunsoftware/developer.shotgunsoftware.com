# {% include product %} AWS Direct Connect Onboarding


## Introduction

AWS Direct Connect (DX) is used to establish private connectivity between AWS and an on-prem facility. DX provides a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and bypasses the public internet. AWS has established 100 Direct Connect locations globally and leverages the AWS Partner Network to extend the footprint.

# Pipeline Integrations

{% include product %} includes integrations that bring the {% include product %} experience into the creative tools artists use every day. Out of the box, you get plugin within artists’ tools that give you the foundation for a basic publish pipeline.

These integrations are built on the Toolkit platform, a set of APIs, UIs, and configurations that give studios the tools to build custom workflows.

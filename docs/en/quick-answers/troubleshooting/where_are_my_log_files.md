#Where are my log files?

By default, Shotgun Desktop and Integrations store their log files in the following directory:

**Mac**

`~/Library/Logs/Shotgun/`

**Windows**

`%APPDATA%\Shotgun\logs\`

**Linux**

`~/.shotgun/logs/`

Log file names are in the form `tk-<ENGINE>.log`, for example `tk-desktop.log` or `tk-maya.log`.

Note that you can also reach this directory from Shotgun Desktop, by selecting a project, clicking the down-arrow 
button to the right of the project name, and choosing "Open Log Folder".

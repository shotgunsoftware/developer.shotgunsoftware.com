# How do I re-setup a Toolkit project using {% include product %} Desktop?

If you’ve already set up a Toolkit configuration for a project and need to start fresh, the Advanced Setup Wizard in {% include product %} Desktop will not allow you to re-setup the project unless you’ve removed the previously setup configuration. 

Here are the steps for manually removing those settings:

1. Delete any `PipelineConfiguration` entities linked to your Project in {% include product %}..<br/><br/>![Access to the PipelineConfiguration entity page](images/pipeline-configuration-entity-page.png)<br/><br/>
2. Set the `Tank Name` field on your `Project` entity in {% include product %} to a blank value.<br/><br/>![Clear the project tank name field](images/clear-project-tank-name.png)<br/><br/>
3. Remove any corresponding pipeline configuration directories on disk..
4. In {% include product %} Desktop select the project you wish to set up. *If you were already viewing the project, jump out to the project list view and then back into your project again.*
6. Now you can run the project setup process again.

**Alternate method**

If you are used to using the command line to set up your project with the  `tank setup_project` command then you can add a `--force` argument to the end of the command. This allows you to set up a previously setup project without following the manual steps listed above.
    
    tank setup_project --force"

# Where is my cache?


## Root Cache Location

Toolkit stores some data in a local cache to prevent unnecessary calls to the {% include product %} server. This includes the [path cache](./what-is-path-cache.md), bundle cache, and thumbnails. While the default location should work for most users, it is configurable using the [cache_location core hook](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-core/blob/master/hooks/cache_location.py) should you need to change it. 

The default cache root location is:

**Mac OS X**

`~/Library/Caches/Shotgun`

**Windows**

`%APPDATA%\Shotgun`

**Linux**

`~/.shotgun`

## Path Cache

The path cache is located at:

`<site_name>/p<project_id>c<pipeline_configuration_id>/path_cache.db`

## Bundle Cache

**Distributed Configurations**

The bundle cache is a cached collection of all the applications, engines, and frameworks used across all of the 
projects on your {% include product %} site. The bundle cache for distributed configs is stored in the following location:

Mac:
`~/Library/Caches/Shotgun/bundle_cache`

Windows:
`%APPDATA%\Shotgun\bundle_cache`

Linux:
`~/.shotgun/bundle_cache`

{% include info title="Note" content="You can override these locations with the `SHOTGUN_BUNDLE_CACHE_PATH` environment variable, so specific implementations may vary." %}

**Centralized Configurations**

The bundle cache for centralized configs are located inside the centralized configuration.

`...{project configuration}/install/` 

If your configuration uses a shared core, then this will be located inside your shared core's install folder instead.

## Thumbnails
 
Thumbnails used by Toolkit apps (like the [Loader](https://developer.shotgridsoftware.com/a4c0a4f1)) are stored in the local Toolkit cache. They are stored per Project, Pipeline Configuration, and App (as needed). The structure beneath the root cache directory is as follows:

`<site_name>/p<project_id>c<pipeline_configuration_id>/<app_or_framework_name>/thumbs/`

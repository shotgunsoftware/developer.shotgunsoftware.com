# I can't use local file linking and launch Toolkit applications from Firefox

## Overview

Sometimes in {% include product %} the action menu will not display the list of Toolkit applications available or will error when using local file linking, even with {% include product %} Desktop running.
This is a guide to troubleshooting {% include product %} Desktop's browser integration in Firefox and will hopefully help you get things working. We have a separate guide for [Chrome](./cant-use-file-linking-toolkit-app-chrome.md).

## Diagnosing the issue

### Is {% include product %} Desktop running?

Yes, we know. You probably already checked. We had to ask. :)

### Are you using firewall software?

Ensure that no firewall software is preventing connections to **localhost** or on port **9000**.

### Is Firefox rejecting the certificate?

You can verify that Firefox accepts the certificate by browsing to https://localhost:9000, which is the address the {% include product %} website tries to access in order to do local file linking and launch Toolkit applications. You should normally be greeted by this message:

![Autobahn Python message](images/autobahn-python.png)

On the other hand, if you are greeted by one of those two messages, it means there was a problem with the certificate registration process:

![Connection is not secure message](images/connection-is-not-secure.png)

![Secure connection failed message](images/connection-failed.png)

## How to fix "Your connection is not secure"

You need to add an exception to the Firefox browser so that the certificate is accepted. If you just visited **https://localhost:9000**, the easiest way to add the exception is by clicking on **Advanced**, then click the **Add Exception** button. A dialog will appear.

Click **Get Certificate** and then **Confirm Security Exception**. You can ignore the message about the certificate not being trusted. This is normal as the certificate was generated by {% include product %} Desktop and not by a certification authority.

You should now be able to access local file linking and launch Toolkit applications from your {% include product %} site. If you are still experiencing issues after adding the exception, please visit our [support site](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/contact-support) for help.

## How to fix "Secure connection failed"

You need to click on the **Open Menu** button and pick **Preferences**. Then pick **Advanced** on the left hand side, **Certificates** and finally **View Certificates**.

In the **Servers** section, click on any item and start typing `localhost` or simply scroll until you find an entry named **localhost:9000**. Delete it. Then, go to the **Authorities** tab and type `localhost` again. You can once again also scroll until you reach the **Autodesk** section with a **localhost** entry underneath. You can remove the **localhost** entry. Once this is done, click **OK** and restart Firefox. Once Firefox has been restarted, browse to **https://localhost:9000**. You should now be greeted by this message:

![Connection is not secure message](images/connection-is-not-secure.png)

At this point, you need to follow the step documented above to add an exception.

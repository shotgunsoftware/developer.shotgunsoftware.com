# Pipeline Integrations

{% include product %}'s pipeline integrations bring {% include product %} data to your artists. Customizable UIs within popular content creation software give artists out-of-the-box tools to view information about their tasks, read and add notes, and share files with teammates. Pipeline integrations are build on the {% include product %} Toolkit platform, and developers can use the Toolkit API to extend functionality or create custom Toolkit apps.

This section contains learning materials to help you get started as you administer a {% include product %} pipeline. You'll find guides to configuring your pipeline and managing your production file system, a tutorial for building a basic vfx pipeline, and resources for writing your own pipeline tools.

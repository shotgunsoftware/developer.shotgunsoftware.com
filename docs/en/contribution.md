# Contribution Guide

In our efforts to work as openly as possible, we have decided to build our developer documentation in a public repository under a [Creative Commons license](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/developer-beta/blob/master/LICENSE.md). If you see a way to make this documentation better, we would love to get a pull request for the repo with improvements. In order to accept a pull request, we need to have one of the following contributor agreements signed by you:

- [Individual Contribution Agreement](../all_langs/contribution/ind_contrib_agmt_for_shotgun_developer_documentation.pdf)
- [Corporate Contribution Agreement](../all_langs/contribution/corp_contrib_agmt_for_shotgun_developer_documentation.pdf)

Once you have submitted one of the above agreements, you can follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/developer-beta/#Making-a-change-to-the-documentation) on how to submit a change.

# Flame

## Installation

The {% include product %} engine for Flame relies on new integration hooks that were added in Flame 2015 Extension 2.  This version of Flame *must* be used in order for the engine to function.  For more info on Flame 2015 Extension 2 (including how to get it), reach out to [Flame Support](http://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Contacting-Autodesk-Flame-or-Smoke-Customer-Support.html).

The simplest way to get started with the {% include product %} engine for Flame is to set up a new test project with our example pipeline configuration. You can do this by launching the {% include product %} Desktop, running the Project Setup for a new project and choosing the default Flame configuration (in the default configurations section).

## Flame Project Setup

The {% include product %} engine for Flame also helps associate the {% include product %} project with a Flame project, and creates it if need be.  This is key to the integration, as it ensures data from Flame gets associated with the right things in {% include product %}.  As an added feature, the engine provides functionality for managing the naming conventions of Flame projects as well as the other various settings for the project.

When Flame is launched via {% include product %} for the first time, a Flame project creation UI will appear that lets the artist edit the usual settings from the standard Flame project creation screen:

![Project](../images/engines/flame_project.png)

But with the {% include product %} integration, the settings can be pre-populated with pipeline-friendly values, helping artists quickly get the right thing without having to think about it.  The defaults can be customized via the `project_setup_hook`, which supports the following options:

`use_project_settings_ui`
If set to `True`, the project creation UI will appear.  If `False`, the Flame project will automatically be created based on the rest of the defaults in the hook.

`get_server_hostname`
By default this is set to 'localhost', but it can be overridden if desired.

`get_project_name`
By default this is set to the same value as the {% include product %} project, but it can be overridden if desired.

`get_volume`
By default this is set to the first available storage, but it can be overridden if desired.

`get_workspace`
By default Flame will create a default workspace according to its standard workspace creation logic, but it can be overridden if desired.

`get_user`
This will try to associate the user logged into the Flame machine with a user in {% include product %}.

`get_project_settings`
This is where the main Flame settings are configured and the hook helps build the Flame project XML stream.  The following parameters *must* be supplied:

* FrameWidth (e.g. `1280`)
* FrameHeight (e.g. `1080`)
* FrameDepth (`16-bit fp`, `12-bit`, `12-bit u`, `10-bit`, `8-bit`) 
* FieldDominance (`PROGRESSIVE`, `FIELD_1`, `FIELD_2`)
* AspectRatio (`4:3`, `16:9`, or floating point value as string)

Proxy settings can also be supplied.  For more info, see the [Autodesk Wiretap SDK docs](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/wiretap)!

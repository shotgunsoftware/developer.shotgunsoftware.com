# Mari Project Manager

The Mari Project Manager streamlines the process of creating new projects in Mari, allowing artists to quickly select published geometry to load using the {% include product %} Loader. Projects created with this app are {% include product %} aware, helping artists publish textures to other parts of the pipeline without having to be concerned about export options and file locations.

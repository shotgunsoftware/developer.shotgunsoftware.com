# Publish

![Publisher](../images/apps/sg_publisher_1.png)

## Overview

The Publish app allows artists to publish their work so that it can be used by artists downstream. It supports traditional publishing workflows within the artistâ€™s content creation software as well as stand-alone publishing of any file on disk. When working in content creation software and using the basic {% include product %} integration, the app will automatically discover and display items for the artist to publish. For more sophisticated production needs, studios can write custom publish plugins to drive artist workflows.

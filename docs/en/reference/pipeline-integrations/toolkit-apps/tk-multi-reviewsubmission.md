# Review Submission

## How do I use this App?

### As an API

This app have a mode that is meant to be called from inside other apps like the multi-publish app.

This mode creates quicktimes from image sequences and submits them as Versions to {% include product %} in order to facilitate review. The generated quicktimes will have slates and burnins. Things such as font, logo position, movie compression options and burnin / slate information are currently hardcoded in the default hooks and as such you are encouraged to re-implement the hook function to adjust the behaviour.

Here are a the current default formats for slate and burnin:

Should you want to leverage this app from within your own apps or hooks here is a quick rundown of the simple way to go about it.

- Get the `tk-multi-reviewsubmission` app from the current engine. This can be done
  from inside a hook using the call `self.parent.engine.apps.get('tk-multi-reviewsubmission')`.
- If the app is available, call the `render_and_submit_version()` method.

Here's an example of what this can look like inside your hook code:

```python
review_submission_app = self.parent.engine.apps.get("tk-multi-reviewsubmission")
if review_submission_app:
    review_submission_app.render_and_submit_version(
        template,
        fields,
        first_frame,
        last_frame,
        sg_publishes,
        sg_task,
        comment,
        thumbnail_path,
        progress_cb,
        color_space
    )
```

The arguments that you need to pass to `render_and_submit_version` are as follows:

* `template`: A template that defines where the files to publish are located
* `fields`: Fields that will be used to fill out the template
* `first_frame`: The first frame of the image sequence to process
* `last_frame`: The last frame of the image sequence to process
* `sg_publishes`: A list of {% include product %} Published File objects to link the version to.
* `sg_task`: A {% include product %} Task link dictionary to link the version to.
* `comment`: Text to add to the Version's description.
* `thumbnail_path`: The path to a thumbnail to use for the version when the movie isn't being uploaded to {% include product %} (this is set in the config)
* `progress_cb`: A callback to report progress with.  This should be of the form: `callback(percent, message)`
* `color_space`: The color space that the input frames are in.  In Nuke, this would be one of the enumeration values on the colorspace knob for the Write node.

### As a menu item

This mode adds a menu item to the {% include product %} menu inside the DCC. 

This mode creates a quick snapshot of the current viewport and sends it to {% include product %} Create as a Version draft. Then, the user can extend the review submission inside of {% include product %} Create by adding annotations, text or comparison notes.

In order to add this functionality to your context, you need to:
* Set the `display_name` field to have it in the menu item.
* Set the `render_media_hook` field to a hook that tells how to render media in your DCC (tk-photoshopcc and tk-maya have a default implementation)
* Set the `submitter_hook` field to `{self}/submitter_create.py`

Like this:

```yaml
tk-multi-reviewsubmission:
  display_name: Send for review
  render_media_hook: '{self}/render_media.py:{self}/{engine_name}/render_media.py'
  submitter_hook: '{self}/submitter_create.py'
  location: 
    type: app_store
    name: tk-multi-reviewsubmission
    version: v1.0.1
```

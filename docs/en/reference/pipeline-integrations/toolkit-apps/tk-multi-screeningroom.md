# Screening Room

This is a small app that hooks up your current Maya session with Screening Room. It will add an item to the {% include product %} menu saying **Jump to Screening Room**. Clicking this button will launch Screening Room and point it at the current {% include product %} Toolkit Context - for example a Shot, Asset or a Task. You can then use Screening Room to browse all submitted content.

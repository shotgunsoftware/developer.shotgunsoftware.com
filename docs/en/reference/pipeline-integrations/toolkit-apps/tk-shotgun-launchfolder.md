# ShotGrid Launch Folder

The Launch Folder App is a {% include product %} utility which allows you to jump from {% include product %} into the File System.

## How it works
The Launch Folder App allows you to jump from {% include product %} into the File System. You can register it for {% include product %} entity types such as Shots, Assets and Sequences. Once activated, it will appear on the Action menu:

![launch folder show in fs](../images/apps/shotgun-launchfoldershow_in_fs.png)

You can select a single or multiple entries in {% include product %} and when you click the menu action a standard file browser will be launched (Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac etc.)

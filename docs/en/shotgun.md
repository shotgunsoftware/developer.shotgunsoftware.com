# {% include product %} Development

Managing a production takes a lot of work to keep all the moving pieces in sync.

Use our {% include product %} REST API or Python API to connect directly to your data, the Event Trigger Framework to automate repetitive tasks, and Action Menu Items to launch your apps directly from {% include product %}'s web interface.

We encourage you to use {% include product %} APIs to develop your own services, applications, modules, and components that operate on or with the Service for your own and your Authorized Usersâ€™ use. 

{% include warning title="Authentication Keys" content="We ask that you do not disclose (and do not permit your Authorized Users to disclose) API Information that includes authentication keys or other means that could allow users to access the Service or its functionality without a log on, or use the APIs yourself to access or allow users to access the Service or its functionality without a log on." %}

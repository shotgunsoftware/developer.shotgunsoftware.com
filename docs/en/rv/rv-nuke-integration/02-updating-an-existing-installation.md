# Updating an Existing Installation

To use a newer version of this Package, in addition to the new code on the “RV side” (which probably was installed with the RV distribution), you need to update the Python code on the “Nuke side”. To do so, just follow the Installation instructions below.

If the RV and Nuke components of the integration package are mismatched, you’ll get an error dialog when you start RV from Nuke.

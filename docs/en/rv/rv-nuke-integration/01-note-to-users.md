# Note to Users

Thanks for trying out the software; the integration toolset is in active development, and we’d very much appreciate any bug reports, feature requests, or other comments.

All feedback can go to [support@shotgunsoftware.com](mailto:support@shotgunsoftware.com).

Before you send us bug reports and feature requests, however, you might want to check over the list of known issues and planned work in the appendix.

And, as always, bug reports accompanied by complete information and/or a test case will be most appreciated.

**Thank You !**

# Creating New Views

All the usual options in the Session Manager for creating and managing new views are available for managing your playblasts, but there are also a couple of hand shortcuts on the *Maya* menu.

##Wipe Selected Playblasts

Select two or more playblasts in the Session Manager and hit this item to arrange them in a Stack, with Wipes mode activated, so that you can grab the edges of the images and slide them over the lower images. Remember that the “()” keys will cycle the stack order, and you can also drag and drop in the Inputs section of the Session Manager to reorder the stack.

##Tile Selected Playblasts

Select two or more playblasts in the Session Manager and hit this item to arrange them in a Tiled Layout.
